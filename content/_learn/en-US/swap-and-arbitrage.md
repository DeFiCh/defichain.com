## Swap using the DEX

Swapping tokens on the DeFiChain DEX (Decentralized Exchange) is easy. At the time of writing, the DEX offers swap for the following pairs:

1. Ethereum–DeFiChain (ETH–DFI)
2. Bitcoin–DeFiChain (BTC–DFI)
3. Tether–DeFiChain (USDT–DFI)

The DeFiChain DEX does not suffer the high gas fees of Ethereum-based DEX, due to network congestion. Afterall, Ethereum being a general purpose blockchain, isn't specifically designed for decentralized finance. DeFiChain on the other hand, is born and made for DeFi, and DeFi only.

### Step 1: Launch the DeFi Wallet app

Don’t have the app installed yet? [Click here for a step-by-step guide on how to do so.](https://defichain.com/learn/defi-app-how-to/?utm_source=defichain&utm_medium=dex-guide&utm_campaign=dex-launch)

### Step 2: Make sure you have DFI in your wallet

After opening the DeFi Wallet App, click **Balances** in the sidebar. Make sure you have funds (DFI) in wallet, as DFI is needed for transaction fees. If you don't yet have DFI, [here is a step-by-step tutorial on how and where you can buy DFI.](https://defichain.ghost.io/where-and-how-to-buy-dfi-defichain/)

### Step 3: Navigate to the DEX (Decentralized Exchange)

Click on **DEX** in the sidebar to access the Decentralized Exchange.

### Step 4: Perform a swap

The DEX provides a way for you to swap one coin for another. In this case, select DFI in the left **From** field.

Then select the coin you want to buy in right **To** field.

You can either specify how much you DFI wish to sell in the **From** field, or how much of the other coin you wish to buy, in the **To** field. You can also click the **MAX** button to enter the maximum amount of DFI.

Click **CONTINUE** when you are ready to swap.

Review the transaction amounts and fees. Then click **SWAP** to confirm.

## Wanna be an Arbitrageur?

As liquidity gets swapped from a DEX (Decentralized Exchange), the ratio of the coins in any of the liquidity pool pairs becomes unbalanced. Because the price of tokens in a liquidity pool does not depend on market prices like in CEXs (centralized exchanges) based on the order book model, one of the coins in a pair can become cheaper or more expensive than the external prices in centralized exchanges. You can either buy low on DeFiChain and sell high on a CEX, or buy low from a CEX and sell high on DeFiChain). This is what we call _arbitrage opportunities_.

Here's an example:

Look for price differences between the DEX and CEXs. For example, at the time of writing, the BTC price of DFI at an exchange like [Bittrex](https://global.bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-DFI) is `0.00002643 BTC per DFI`. Compared to Bittrex, the price of BTC in the DEX is `0.00002522 BTC per DFI`. BTC is more expensive at the DEX than Bittrex.

### Swapping DFI for BTC

All we need to do is buy 1 BTC at Bittrex with `38,587.61607637 DFI`.

Then sell the `1 BTC` for `39,355.98845598 DFI` on the DEX, for a profit of `768.37237961 DFI` – about 2% for a single day. When the prices vary more, the arbitrage opportunities can get way higher.

[Download the DeFi Wallet desktop app](/downloads) available for macOS, Windows and Linux, to use the DEX. You too, can be an arbitrageur.
