## What is liquidity mining?

Liquidity mining is a DeFi (decentralized finance) mechanism in which participants supply cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools, and being rewarded with fees and tokens based on their share of the total pool liquidity. Liquidity pools in DeFiChain consist of liquidity in pairs of coins, used by the DeFiChain DEX (Decentralized Exchange).

## Adding liquidity

### Step 1: Launch the DeFiChain app

Don't have the app installed yet? [Click here for a step-by-step guide on how to do so.](https://defichain.com/learn/defi-app-how-to/?utm_source=defichain&utm_medium=dex-guide&utm_campaign=dex-launch)

### Step 2: Navigate to Liquidity

Click on **Liquidity** in the sidebar to access the liquidity pools.

### Step 3: Learn more

When you first land on **Liquidity**, you will be presented with videos you can watch to learn more about liquidity mining on DeFiChain and how the DEX works. The video on _impermanent loss_ is also helpful. 

<img src="/img/guides/liquidity-mining/liquidity-welcome.png" srcset="/img/guides/liquidity-mining/liquidity-welcome.png 1x, /img/guides/liquidity-mining/liquidity-welcome@2x.png 2x">

Below the videos, you'd find a list of _pool pairs_. Within each pool pair the total liquidity in it and APR is displayed.

### Step 4: Decide which pool pair to supply liquidity to

You can supply liquidity to the ETH-DFI, BTH-DFI and USDT-DFI pool. Whichever pool pair you decide to supply to, you will need the corresponding coins in your wallet. For example, if you wish to supply liquidity to the BTC-DFI pool, you need to have sufficient BTC (wrapped BTC) and DFI in your wallet. The current version of DeFiChain only accepts wrapped tokens (wrapped ETH/BTH/USDT). If you do not currently have any wrapped tokens, [check out this guide](/learn/obtaining-wrapped-tokens).

Once you are ready to supply liquidity to any of the pool pairs, click **ADD LIQUIDITY**. You can also click the **+** button for any of the pool pairs to specifically add liquidity to that pool pair.

### Step 5: Adding liquidity

In this example, we will add liquidity to the BTC-DFI pool pair. Enter the input amounts for both the BTC side and DFI side. You can make use of the **MAX** buttons to add the maximum amount for each coin, available in your wallet. When you enter an amount on one side of the pair, the app automatically balances the amount of the other side, based on the ratio of current liquidity in the pool.

_TIP: If clicking **MAX** on a side causes an "Insufficient balance" warning, simply click **MAX** on the other side of the pair._

Next, select the address you want to receive shares and rewards at. Unless you want to receive rewards at a specific address, you can usually leave this field unchanged.

When you are ready to add, click **CONTINUE**.

Verify the deposits, rates and pool share, then click **SUPPLY** to confirm.

The app will then prepare the transaction, followed by adding your liquidity to the blockchain. Do not navigate away from this screen or close the app while the transaction is being prepared.

Once the transaction has gone through. You will see the transaction hash. You can click **VIEW ON CHAIN** to view the transaction on the DeFiChain Explorer, or click **BACK TO POOL** to see your added liquidity in the app.

### Step 6: Check your liquidity

You will now see your added liquidity above the **Available pool pairs** table.

## Removing liquidity

### Step 1: Removing

Click on the **-** button in the pool pair that you have supplied liquidity to.

<img src="/img/guides/liquidity-mining/liquidity-remove-button.png" srcset="/img/guides/liquidity-mining/liquidity-remove-button.png 1x, /img/guides/liquidity-mining/liquidity-remove-button@2x.png 2x">

### Step 2: How much to remove

Enter the amount of liquidity you wish to remove, either by typing the percentage value or using the slider. Next, select the address you want the removed liquidity to go back to. Unless you want to remove to a specific address, you can usually leave this field unchanged.

<img src="/img/guides/liquidity-mining/liquidity-removing.png" srcset="/img/guides/liquidity-mining/liquidity-removing.png 1x, /img/guides/liquidity-mining/liquidity-removing@2x.png 2x">

Then click **CONTINUE**.

### Step 3: Confirmation

Verify the amount of liquidity to remove and receive address, then press **CONFIRM**.

Wait for the removal transaction to be prepared and processed.
