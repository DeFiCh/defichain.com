### Step 2: Dealing with macOS security prompt when opening the app

Open the app. The first time you open the DeFi app, you will be presented with a security prompt. Press OK to dismiss it.

\*_You will see this security prompt with early unsigned releases of the app. In future releases signed with Apple, you will not see security prompts. For now, please follow step 3 for a workaround._

### Step 3: Allow app execution

\*_Only open the app this way if you are sure you have downloaded DeFi app from an official source. DeFi app is currently only available on the [official website](/) and [DeFiChainâ€™s GitHub](https://github.com/DeFiCh/app/releases)._

Go to **System Preferences** and click on **Security & Privacy**.

## Installing on Windows

### Step 1: Installation

Double click on the downloaded file.

### Step 2: Windows security prompt

If this is the first time you are installing the DeFi app, the installer may present you with a security prompt as shown. Click **More info**.

\*_Microsoft Windows SmartScreen may flag newly uploaded files that have not built up a long enough history._

You can now open DeFi app.

## Installing on Linux using Debian

You can choose to either install DeFi app as a GUI tool or command line tool.

### Using Software Center

The simplest method is to use Software Center in Ubuntu. Simply navigate to the folder (usually _Downloads_ folder) containing the downloaded **.deb** file and open it.

### Install .deb files in command line using dpkg

If you want to install **deb** packages using the command line, you can use either the `apt` command or the `dpkg` command.

```
sudo apt install PATH_TO_DEB_FILE
```

or

```
sudo dpkg -i PATH_TO_DEB_FILE
```

You can now open DeFi app.
